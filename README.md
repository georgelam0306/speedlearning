Through good memorization training techniques, and proper speed reading training techniques, anybody can reach 800 wpm and beyond while mainting 90% comprehenssion of the material.

## Problem ##
  People spend a lot of time wasted through poor learning techniques.  Other speed learning apps do a poor job of teaching the proper techniques of speed learning, and are focused on only one area of development.
